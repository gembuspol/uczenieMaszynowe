Overall, “Good Time” is a strong drama with complex characters, great visuals, and unforgettable music. It is a movie about criminals, but unlike most gangster movies, you will not find any romanticism or nostalgia here. It is a dark, hopeless underworld existing right next to our everyday lives—an underside of our society. Things depicted in “Good Time” happen every day–and this film is your peephole to the other side.
